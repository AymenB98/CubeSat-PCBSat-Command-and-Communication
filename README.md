# CubeSat-PCBSat-Command-and-Communication
- This software is being written to allow for a CubeSat to relay commands from a ground station to a swarm of femtosatellites.
- The software for this project was written by adapting code examples written by TI and made available on the SimpleLink platform.
- This code enables a CubeSat to be able to relay commands from a ground station to a femtosatellite, as well as relaying data from the femtosatellite to the ground station.

# Hardware
The targeted hardware platform for this code is the CC1310 SoC by TI. The CC1310 Launchpad is the hardware development kit manufactured by TI.
This code was tested on these HDKs. Further advice on programming a custom design with a CC1310 SoC should be sought through TI's various resources.
